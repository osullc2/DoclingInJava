# Step 3: Complex Python Library in Java

This folder will contain a Maven project that demonstrates using a more complex Python library (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, or another heavy-weight library) from Java using GraalVM polyglot.

## Status

🚧 **Coming Soon** - This step will be implemented after Step 2.

## Planned Features

- Use a complex Python library with dependencies
- Handle library initialization and configuration
- Work with complex data structures
- Manage Python virtual environments if needed
- Performance considerations for complex libraries
